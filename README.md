# events_manage
## Getting Started

in the day 10/09/2024 i decided to create an system 
that you can handel cinema by .
>
there is an api that you can get the data of the films guests and reservation 
because im a beginner in django rest frame work  and my basic job is flutter dev.
i made a very simple small and very basic django api so i can handel the restfull api 
in the flutter app >>
I just wanted to show my abilities and skills in dealing with API in the four operations get put post delete

I also dealt with Firebase to show my skills in dealing with Google databases .. In this system

We will create an API to deal with the backend using Django and we will create a desktop application to deal

With employees and the system completely from listing employees and listing guests and movies and reservations

.. (I know that what I will do now is a programming error, but I am forced because of my level in Django RestFramework)

Where I gave permissions to the manager and the employee in frontend dev. This is a mistake if we look at it from a programming perspective..
The computer program can only be accessed by the manager and employees and guests can never access it
Because there is a special application for guests that works on Android and iOS phones where they can do specific things..
Here in the computer application I gave the general manager permissions to create people and give them permissions, for example
He can create a general manager or an employee.. The general manager can create an employee, movies, guests, reservations
and modify anything in the program.. But the employee can only access and control the guest data and modify it
He cannot modify the movie or create new movies..
I relied on Firebase as a database for specific things and on Rest API
I relied on Cubit to manage cases..
